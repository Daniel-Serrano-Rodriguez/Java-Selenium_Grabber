 Simple project to download videos.

 ## Must

 - Use Firefox.
 - Create a profile in about.config called "selenium"
 - Pop-ups must be blocked for this to work, recommended to block ads too, with [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) and [Popup Blocker (strict)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/popup-blocker/) should work.
